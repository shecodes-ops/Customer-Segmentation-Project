# Customer-Segmentation-Project
To analyze the content of an E-commerce database that lists purchases made by ∼∼ 4000 customers over a period of one year (from 2010/12/01 to 2011/12/09). Based on this analysis, we will develop a model that allows the store owner to anticipate the purchases that will be made by a new customer, during the following year.
The dataset for this project can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JFBa7bDqAyhCBIois-89W2lrbN0FBbAL/view?usp=sharing).
I also published a more detailed report of the [project](https://www.dearanalyst.com/customer-segmentation-in-ecommerce/)
