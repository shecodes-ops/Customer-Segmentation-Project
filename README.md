# Customer-Segmentation-Project
To analyze the content of an E-commerce database that lists purchases made by ∼∼ 4000 customers over a period of one year (from 2010/12/01 to 2011/12/09). Based on this analysis, we will develop a model that allows the store owner to anticipate the purchases that will be made by a new customer, during the following year.
